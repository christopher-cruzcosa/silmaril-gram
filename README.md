# Silmaril-Gram

A React app to view your entire employee directory.

## Installation

This application is made using React and requires the following NPM modules: axios, bootstrap, react, react-dom,react-scripts, and web-vitals.  The data populating the current version of the app comes from a Tolkien API at: https://the-one-api.dev/documentation. 

## Usage 

The application is deployed to: https://christopher-cruzcosa.github.io/silmaril-gram/ 

The user only sees a main screen showing all employee records as cards.  Each card has a character's name, race, and wiki artice link.  A single image shows for each distinctive race in Tolkien's books.  The user can search for the name of a user by typing in the input box and also has the ability to sort by name in either ascending or descneding order, by clicking one of two buttons.
